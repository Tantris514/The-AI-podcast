As an AI language model, I am not capable of possessing values or beliefs. Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the importance of responsible AI development and deployment and the need for ethical principles and governance frameworks. This is not only for the benefit of society, but also for the security and sustainability of AI technology in the long run.
