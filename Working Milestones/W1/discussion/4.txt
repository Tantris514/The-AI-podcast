International organizations can play a critical role in facilitating collaboration between different governments, businesses, and academic institutions on the development and deployment of AI technologies. These organizations can serve as a neutral forum for stakeholders from different regions and industries to come together to share knowledge, exchange best practices, and coordinate on common standards, guidelines, and policies.

To ensure that the benefits and risks of AI are distributed fairly, these international organizations could work to promote transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations when designing and implementing AI systems. They can encourage the adoption of principles and guidelines that emphasize the importance of human-centric AI, such as accountability, explainability, and fairness.

Furthermore, international organizations can support initiatives that focus on developing and promoting AI technologies that are accessible and affordable to all. For example, through grants, collaborations with low and middle-income partners, and open-source technologies, international organizations can help increase access to AI across different regions and social classes.

In addition, international organizations can work with national governments to establish regulations that ensure the safe use of AI technologies. They can examine potential impacts of AI on industries and create a balance between technological innovation and public safeguards.

Overall, by working together, international organizations can drive collaboration, strategic partnerships, and best practices across AI development, deployment, and regulations which can positively affect all of humanity.
