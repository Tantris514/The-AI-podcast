As an artificial intelligence language model, I cannot have a preference, but we could discuss the following points to begin with:

1. The current state of AI and its limitations: What are the current capabilities of AI, and what are its limitations in terms of real-life applications?

2. The ethical implications of AI: As AI becomes more sophisticated, what are the ethical considerations around its usage? What kind of responsibilities do we have as we develop AI?

3. The future of AI in society and the workplace: As AI gains more traction in society and the workplace, what kind of impact will it have on our daily lives? Will there be a shift in the job market as more tasks become automated? How will this affect society as a whole?

4. The potential risks and benefits of AI: What are the potential risks and benefits of AI, and how can we maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks? 

5. The role of humans in the age of AI: As AI becomes more advanced, what is the role of humans in society? How can we ensure that AI is developed in a way that enhances, rather than replaces, human skills and creativity?
